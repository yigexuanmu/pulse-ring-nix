// src/components/visualizer/diorama/DioramaScene.tsx
// Renders the lyric corridor along the winding path. Each nearby lyric line is staged on its path
// frame (per-line offset, scale, roll, yaw), plus a per-line procedural geometry formation matched to
// that line's camera move. Text, camera and geometry all read from the same shared `frames` +
// placements, so everything stays consistent as the path bends. Formation anchors render as a single
// self-lit point-cloud field; camera, text and transition logic remain independent from audio.
//
// TEXT is canvas-rasterised (see dioramaTextRaster.ts for why not SDF): the browser's own text engine
// draws every glyph - perfect stroke continuity for every script and the full shared subtitle font
// stack (theme style, weight, uploaded custom font, fallback). The ACTIVE line renders as INDIVIDUAL
// units (every CJK char / latin word its own plane), laid out by measuring the full line so kerning
// is preserved; behind each unit sits an additive plane holding the cadenza (心象) glow raster of the
// SAME glyph - registration is exact by construction. 辉光跟唱 follows the classic reveal model: the
// sung unit turns accent-coloured and lit, finished units return to plain bright, unsung units wait
// dim; each unit's light swells/decays on its own smoothed envelope, breathing with the music.
//
// The music is expressed HERE, in the world - never in the camera: bass accelerates the point-cloud
// flow while treble increases curl disturbance and sparkle. Particle clouds AND text live a
// distance-based LIFECYCLE: born
// from the far haze (no pop-in) and dissolving gracefully when the camera closes in. Theme colours
// are DAMPED per-frame (fog, lights, materials), so theme/AI theme changes and song switches glide
// instead of snapping. All per-frame values are refs inside useFrame - never React state.
