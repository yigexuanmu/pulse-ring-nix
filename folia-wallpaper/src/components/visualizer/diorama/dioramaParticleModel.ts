 * Per-band tracker that separates the two signals the geometry needs, and - crucially - does NOT lose

 *
 * The previous model was `onset = level - EMA(level)`. A single symmetric EMA converges to the MEAN of
 * its input, so under a steady kick pattern the reference climbed toward the kick itself and the onset
 * shrank away: the drums were still there, the geometry had simply decided they were the new background.
 * (It also started at 0, so the first seconds read `onset = level` - a full-scale spike. That inflated
 * opening was the "normal" the rest of the song then appeared to decay away from. Both halves of the
 * reported symptom came from this one line.)
 *
 * Instead we track the band's VALLEY and its PEAK separately, each asymmetric:
 *
 *   floor - rises slowly, falls fast. A kick is too brief to drag it up, so it settles in the gaps
 *           BETWEEN kicks. `fast - floor` is then the kick's full height, forever, however long the
 *           pattern runs. When the drums actually stop, the floor drops out from under it within ~0.25s
 *           and the response falls away on its own - so this stays honest, not a latch.
 *   peak  - rises fast, falls slowly (~3.5s of memory). This is the only adaptive part, and it can only
 *           adapt to how loud the SONG is, which is what it is for. Its fall is bounded and MIN_RANGE
 *           stops a near-silent passage from being normalised back up into full-scale flicker.
 *
 * transient = (fast - floor) / (peak - floor): the kick, normalised against the band's own live dynamic
 *             range. Loudness-invariant, and constant under a constant beat.
 * sustained = fast / peak: how present this band is relative to the song, which does NOT self-cancel
 *             (a held bass note keeps reading high) - the continuous-energy signal.
